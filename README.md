# Endless-Adventures ✈️🏝☀️

A website that allows travel enthusiasts like myself to upload an image and find its exact location on Google Maps, along with the make and model of the device the image was taken on. If viewers need travel inspiration, they can view the photo gallery for pictures from my personal travels!

This website was made with HTML/CSS and the logic behind the image identifier (where it accesses the EXIF data of the image that was uploaded by the user) was made using Javascript.
